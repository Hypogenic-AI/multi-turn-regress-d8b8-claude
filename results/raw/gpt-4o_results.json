      "The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight, or white light, is composed of multiple colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere more than other colors with longer wavelengths, such as red or yellow. This scattering causes the direct sunlight to lose some of its blue light, which is why the sun itself can appear more yellow or red, especially when it is lower in the sky. The scattered blue light is what we see when we look up during the day, giving the sky its characteristic blue color.\n\nDuring sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or pink because the sun is lower on the horizon, and its light has to pass through a greater thickness of Earth's atmosphere. This increased distance causes even more scattering of the shorter wavelengths, allowing the longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky's appearance. Additionally, particles and pollutants in the atmosphere can enhance this effect, leading to more vivid colors. This is why the sky can take on such dramatic hues during these times, contrasting with the typical blue seen during the day."
