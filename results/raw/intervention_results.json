This scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\nDuring sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on shades of red, orange, and pink. This occurs because the sun is lower on the horizon, and its light has to pass through a greater thickness of the Earth's atmosphere. As a result, the blue light is scattered out of the direct line of sight, while the longer wavelengths of red and orange light are less affected by scattering and become more visible. This interplay of light and atmospheric conditions is what creates the beautiful colors we see in the sky at different times of the day."
