      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of various colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors like red or yellow. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles present in the air. This scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\nDuring sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on shades of red and orange instead of blue. This occurs because the sunlight has to pass through a greater thickness of the Earth's atmosphere at these times. As a result, the blue light is scattered out of the direct line of sight, while the longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, are less affected by scattering and become more visible. This interplay of light and atmospheric conditions explains the varying colors of the sky throughout the day."
