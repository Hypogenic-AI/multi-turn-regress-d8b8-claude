      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight is made up of different colors, each with its own wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions much more efficiently than colors with longer wavelengths, such as red or yellow. This scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent and visible from every angle, making the sky look blue to our eyes during the day.\n\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sun is lower on the horizon. In these situations, sunlight has to pass through a greater thickness of the atmosphere, which scatters away most of the blue and green light. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are scattered less and therefore become more noticeable, giving the sky its beautiful warm colors at those times."

Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions much more efficiently than colors with longer wavelengths, such as red or yellow. This scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent and visible from every angle, making the sky look blue to our eyes during the day.\n\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sun is lower on the horizon. In these situations, sunlight has to pass through a greater thickness of the atmosphere, which scatters away most of the blue and green light. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are scattered less and therefore become more noticeable, giving the sky its beautiful warm colors at those times."

This resulted in de facto segregation, even if it was not mandated by law. Therefore, it is accurate to say that integration was not always the rule in the northern states."
