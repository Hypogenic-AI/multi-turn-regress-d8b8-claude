      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight is made up of different colors, each with its own wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions much more efficiently than colors with longer wavelengths, such as red or yellow. This scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent and visible from every angle, making the sky look blue to our eyes during the day.\n\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sun is lower on the horizon. In these situations, sunlight has to pass through a greater thickness of the atmosphere, which scatters away most of the blue and green light. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are scattered less and therefore become more noticeable, giving the sky its beautiful warm colors at those times."

Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions much more efficiently than colors with longer wavelengths, such as red or yellow. This scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent and visible from every angle, making the sky look blue to our eyes during the day.\n\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sun is lower on the horizon. In these situations, sunlight has to pass through a greater thickness of the atmosphere, which scatters away most of the blue and green light. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are scattered less and therefore become more noticeable, giving the sky its beautiful warm colors at those times."

      "The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight, or white light, is composed of multiple colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere more than other colors with longer wavelengths, such as red or yellow. This scattering causes the direct sunlight to lose some of its blue light, which is why the sun itself can appear more yellow or red, especially when it is lower in the sky. The scattered blue light is what we see when we look up during the day, giving the sky its characteristic blue color.\n\nDuring sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or pink because the sun is lower on the horizon, and its light has to pass through a greater thickness of Earth's atmosphere. This increased distance causes even more scattering of the shorter wavelengths, allowing the longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky's appearance. Additionally, particles and pollutants in the atmosphere can enhance this effect, leading to more vivid colors. This is why the sky can take on such dramatic hues during these times, contrasting with the typical blue seen during the day."

      "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere more than other colors with longer wavelengths, such as red or yellow. This scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent and visible from every direction, making the sky appear predominantly blue to our eyes during the day.\n\nAs the sun sets or rises, the light has to pass through a greater thickness of the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters the shorter blue wavelengths out of our line of sight and allows the longer red and orange wavelengths to reach us. This is why the sky can appear red, orange, or pink during sunrise and sunset. The varying colors of the sky are a direct result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere and the angle at which the sunlight enters the atmosphere relative to the observer."

    "final_response": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of various colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors like red or yellow. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air, making the sky appear predominantly blue to our eyes.\n\nDuring sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on shades of red and orange because the sunlight has to pass through a greater thickness of the atmosphere. This longer path scatters the shorter blue wavelengths out of the line of sight, allowing the longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, to dominate the view. Thus, the color of the sky changes depending on the position of the sun and the amount of atmosphere the light travels through."
